# box.web
A small CSS framework. 
# Installation
Load the CSS onto your website using jsdelivr (this isn't a good option for high-bandwith sites because the file is dynamically generated).
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teymour-aldridge/box.web/sass/styles.min.css">
```
# JS interface
[Mithril](https://mithril.js.org) is a small javascript framework for which an interface to allow the easy use of box.web is being built.
