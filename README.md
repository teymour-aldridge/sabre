# Sabre
A small CSS framework. 
# Installation
Load the CSS onto your website using jsdelivr (this isn't a good option for high-bandwidth sites because the file is dynamically generated).
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/teymour-aldridge/sabre/sass/styles.min.css">
```
